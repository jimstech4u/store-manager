-- 0088 — The ledger records the deposit that was actually taken
--
-- «the bad container out you collect 125 naira each that is sitting on ui and no where to manage
--  that and we have even changed it»
--
-- A deposit has no fixed rate in this trade. It is agreed at the counter — per customer, per load,
-- sometimes not at all — and `empties_categories.deposit` is a suggestion the shop starts from, not
-- a price. `record_sale` was stamping that suggestion onto every ledger row for which any money at
-- all had been taken.
--
-- So a shop collecting N125 a crate against a pool that says N500 recorded itself as holding four
-- times what it had. The customer's account said so, the empties screen said so, and settling would
-- have paid back four times what was received — out of a till that never got it. Nothing would have
-- looked wrong until the money did.
--
-- The rate now comes from the money. Where a line sends out two kinds of returnable at once — the
-- bottles and the crate they arrived in — the one figure from the counter is split in proportion to
-- what each pool is nominally worth, and where the shop has set no standard rate at all, by how
-- many containers each pool is owed. Both are stated rather than assumed, because a split nobody
-- can explain is a figure nobody can argue with.
